// Package certtest provides throwaway self-signed certificate material for
// tests. It is the test-support companion to httpx's CA-pinning surface
// (CATransport and the caCertPool builder it wraps): a consumer that pins a
// private or self-signed CA needs a valid CA certificate to exercise its
// wiring, and hand-rolling the crypto/x509 dance in every such test is
// error-prone boilerplate.
//
// The generated certificate is a minimal ECDSA CA valid for one hour. It is
// meant to be parsed and loaded into a pool (or fed to CATransport), never to
// secure a real production connection.
//
// This lives in its own package rather than in httpx so the
// certificate-generation code is never linked into a consumer's production
// binary: it is reachable only from the _test.go files that import it, the same
// way the standard library ships net/http/httptest alongside net/http.
