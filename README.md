# httpx

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/cplieger/httpx/v5.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cplieger/httpx/v5) [![Go version](https://img.shields.io/github/go-mod/go-version/cplieger/httpx)](https://github.com/cplieger/httpx/blob/main/go.mod) [![Mutation](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cplieger/httpx/badges/mutation.json)](https://github.com/cplieger/httpx/issues?q=label%3Agremlins-tracker)

httpx makes your Go HTTP calls survive flaky servers, with retries, backoff and Retry-After built in.

It replaces the retry loop, status check and redirect policy you would otherwise write around `net/http`, and it hands back a plain `*http.Client`. It uses only the standard library at run time, needs Go 1.27 or later and is licensed under Apache-2.0.

## Why use it

httpx is built for Go code that must keep working when a remote API fails for a moment.

- `Do` retries a typed operation, `GetBytes` fetches a capped body, and a retrying `http.RoundTripper` fits an existing `*http.Client`.
- Each decides which network errors and status codes to retry. `GetBytes` and the transport honor `Retry-After` up to 60 seconds.
- `GetBytes` removes a URL's username, password and query values from its logs and error messages.
- The default redirect policy keeps custom auth headers on the host you called. No shipped policy follows an `https` to `http` hop unless you opt in.
- `GetBytes` fails on a body over its 10 MB default cap instead of cutting it.

Consider [cenkalti/backoff](https://github.com/cenkalti/backoff) if you want to choose your own backoff policy, through its `WithBackOff` option. Consider [failsafe-go](https://github.com/failsafe-go/failsafe-go) if you need a circuit breaker, a rate limiter or a bulkhead, policies it wraps around any function.

## Install

```sh
go get github.com/cplieger/httpx/v5@latest
```

## Usage

```go
// A client with a timeout that follows same-host redirects only.
client := httpx.NewClient(30 * time.Second)

// Three attempts with backoff, a body capped at 10 MB, the URL redacted in logs.
body, err := httpx.GetBytes(ctx, client, "https://api.example.com/items")
```

For code that already works with `*http.Client`, put the retry in the transport:

```go
client := httpx.NewRetryClient(nil, httpx.DefaultRedirectPolicy, httpx.TransportConfig{MaxAttempts: 4})
resp, err := client.Do(req)
```

`NewRetryClient` panics on a nil redirect policy, because a nil `CheckRedirect` means net/http follows redirects to any host. Pass `DefaultRedirectPolicy`, `RefuseAllRedirects` or a `RedirectPolicyFunc` allowlist.

Retry any operation and keep its typed result:

```go
items, err := httpx.Do(ctx, func(ctx context.Context) ([]Item, error) {
    return fetchItems(ctx)
}, httpx.WithMaxAttempts(4), httpx.WithLabel("fetch items"))
```

Turn a response status into a typed error. Only a 2xx returns nil:

```go
if err := httpx.CheckHTTPStatus(resp); err != nil {
    // *AuthError for 401 and 403, *RateLimitError for 429, *HTTPStatusError otherwise.
}
```

`ExampleGetBytes` and `ExampleDo` on pkg.go.dev are runnable, and `go test` keeps them true.

## API

- Retry: `Do[T]`, `GetBytes`, `NewRetryRoundTripper`, `NewRetryClient` and `NewClient`, with their options, `TransportConfig` and `ContextWithDefaultTimeout`.
- Backoff and Retry-After: `JitteredBackoff`, `SafeDouble`, `SleepCtx`, `ParseRetryAfter`, `ParseRetryAfterResponse`.
- Classification: `IsTransient`, `Permanent`, `MarkTransient`, `AttemptTimeout`, `IsRetryableStatus`, the `Transient` and `RetryAfterHint` interfaces.
- Status and errors: `CheckHTTPStatus` and the `AuthError`, `RateLimitError`, `HTTPStatusError`, `StatusError` and `ResponseTooLargeError` types.
- Redirects: `DefaultRedirectPolicy`, `RefuseAllRedirects` and `RedirectPolicyFunc` with its options.
- TLS: `CATransport` pins a private CA, `CloneDefaultTransport`, and the `certtest` package for tests.
- Redaction: `LogSafeError`, `RedactSecret`, `RedactSecretString`, `RedactTransportError`.
- Bodies and caching: `ReadLimitedBody`, `LimitedBody`, `Drain`, `DrainClose`, `DoConditional`.

## Retries and timeouts

`Do`, `GetBytes` and the retrying transport each count total attempts, three by default. Between attempts they wait a random time between half and all of a delay that starts at one second and doubles. In `GetBytes` and the transport, a `Retry-After` header replaces that wait, capped at 60 seconds.

The three entry points retry different failures on purpose. All of them retry transient network errors. `GetBytes` also retries 408, 429 and every 5xx. The transport also retries 429, 502, 503 and 504. It retries only GET, HEAD, OPTIONS and TRACE unless you set `RetryNonIdempotent`. With that set, a request with a body is retried only when it has a `GetBody` function to replay the body. `Do` treats a `*RateLimitError` as final unless you pass `WithRateLimitRetry`.

When the transport runs out of attempts, it hands back the last response as a normal response, with a nil error, even when that response is a 503. So check `resp.StatusCode` and close the body.

A context deadline is the total budget and is never retried. A per-attempt timeout is retried, whether it is `WithAttemptTimeout` under `Do` or `ResponseHeaderTimeout` on the transport. Do not set `Client.Timeout` on a retrying client, because it caps the whole retry sequence.

[Retries](docs/retries.md) and [Timeouts and deadlines](docs/timeouts.md) have the full contract.

## Credentials in logs and redirects

Go forwards custom headers such as `X-Api-Key` across a redirect. `DefaultRedirectPolicy` follows same-host hops only, and every shipped policy refuses an `https` to `http` downgrade. A `RedirectPolicyFunc` allowlist follows the other hosts you name, and allows a downgrade only with `WithAllowSchemeDowngrade(true)`. `RefuseAllRedirects` follows none and hands the 3xx back to you, which `CheckHTTPStatus` reports as an error.

In its log lines and error messages, `GetBytes` replaces a URL's userinfo and each query value with `REDACTED`. It reduces transport errors to their cause, so their text carries no raw URL. The exported `StatusError.URL` field still holds the original URL for your code, so do not log that field. URL paths are kept, so do not put a credential in a URL path you pass to `GetBytes`. `RedactSecretString` takes the secret as the `Secret` type, so swapping the two arguments does not compile.

[Redirects, TLS and redaction](docs/security-model.md) covers each policy option, the pinned-CA transport and the order to redact in.

## Unsupported by design

httpx has no circuit breaker, retry budget, alternative jitter strategies, exhaustion error handler, response body on error, idempotency-key injection or configurable Retry-After cap. [Unsupported by design](docs/non-goals.md) gives the reason for each and what to use instead.

## Documentation

- [Retries](docs/retries.md) covers the three ways to retry, their options, backoff, rate limits, exhaustion and logging.
- [Timeouts and deadlines](docs/timeouts.md) says which timeouts are retried and where to put each bound.
- [Status codes, errors and bodies](docs/responses.md) lists the status mapping, error types, body caps and conditional GET.
- [Redirects, TLS and redaction](docs/security-model.md) covers redirect policies, the pinned-CA transport and keeping secrets out of logs.
- [Unsupported by design](docs/non-goals.md) lists the features left out on purpose, with the reasons.
